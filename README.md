## CRM
This is a Customer Relationship Management system for small Managed IT Companies. This was developed so we didn't have to worry about managing 
three different systems. Before we used to use a wiki for internal and client documentation. Accounting software and invoicing software. This is an all in
one solution.
This is still in early development stages and by no means ready for the primetime. Please report bugs, and send some pulls, if you find this useful.
